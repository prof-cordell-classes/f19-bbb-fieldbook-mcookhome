# Proposal: Ultimate Zine

#### Matthew Cook and Ben Centracchio

*1. The content of your book. What will it be about?*
Our zine will be a one-stop shop for all relevant content relating to the Ultimate Frisbee program at Northeastern, which consists of a men’s A, B, and C team as well as a womxn’s A and B team. It will have a section devoted to recent results on the field, with summaries (hopefully) written by members of the competing teams. We will likely have opinion pieces written by members of the community on pertinent issues (currently, deciding what colors of shorts we will wear on our jerseys this year). We could have updates from leadership about things such as personal fundraising requirements. We can also put a mini-calendar of events going on in the program until the next issue. Finally, we will have informative features about topics related (or tangentially related) to the sport.

*2. The format of your book. Will it be printed and bound? A zine? An ebook? A hybrid? Something else?*

It will be a zine. We are unsure about the number of issues, but we expect about two to four issues consisting of eight to twelve pages each.

*3. The skills you will need in order to execute your project, as well as a plan for acquiring those skills, particularly if they are not skills we will formally study together. There will be class periods devoted to individual learning that can be used to facilitate such supplemental skill development.*We have the connections and creative writing abilities to produce all our content. As for artistically creating the zine, we will probably research how others have created their zines. Art is not our strong suit, but what time is better than now to learn!

*4. The materials you will need to complete your project, as well as a plan for acquiring these materials.*

It will mostly be made of paper: cardstock and colored construction paper seem ideal, and we can print written “articles”. 

*5. The equipment you will need in order to complete your project, as well as a plan for accessing that equipment. Some of this equipment may be readily available through Huskiana Press (attached to our classroom), but even so you should outline a plan for use.*

We will need a large quantity of magazines to cut out letters to paste into our project. Also, if possible, we will likely take inspiration from the prior student who made expert zines. We will also have to find a place to make large amounts of copies of our zines once they’re finished, for the sake of distribution. Otherwise, we just need paper. We would like to figure out a way to incorporate using the Huskiana Press, but we are unsure how. If you have any ideas, please let us know!

*6. The team working on your book. Is this an individual or group project? If the latter, what does each member bring to the group?*

This is a partner project by Matthew Cook and Ben Centracchio. Each of us will contribute equally to the zines, all the way from content creation to printing and distributing. We should have an equal say as to the administrative decisions of the zine, and divide an equal load. Most of the work will be done while we’re together, so it won’t be difficult to divvy up who does what. Neither of us have extensive backgrounds in visual arts or editing, so we will figure out what skills suit us best as they come along. 

*7. A plan for evaluating the project. What are your goals for this book, and how will we know whether and to what extent those goals have been met?*

Our main goal is to create a product that the NU ultimate community values. We will be successful if we feel proud to have others read it. Quality, creativity and content contribute to that. As for timeline, the hope is to have our first issue mostly put together by the prototype deadline on November 1st.
