# Reading Prep: Binding

#### Matthew Cook

## Questions or Observations

1. I have rarely thought of the consequences of binding. Should binding conform to the content it houses? If so, what features of binding do we associate with certain forms of content?
2. As soon as they began going into great detail on the binding and sealing of Baxter's book, I anticipated that it would end up with none of them actually reading the poem. Why do we value unused things more than used things? At what point does a book's use become valuable in and of itself?
3. It's cool that many textures can be raised to type-height to be printed (see: the birch bark). What are some other cool textures that could be printed by letterpress?
