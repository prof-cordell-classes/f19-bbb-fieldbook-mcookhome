# Reading Prep: Zines

#### Matthew Cook

## Questions or Observations

1. My favorite quote in the NYT article is about the motive behind creating zines:

   > For him, the act of creating a zine is more about defining his reality on his terms and legitimizing it than it is about the novelty of making indie media and distributing it.

   Zines seem to not revolve around making a profit, whereas many other forms of books have a monetary incentive. How does that lack of capitalist influence affect the content of zines? Do other authors alter their content to be more marketable?

2. Erasure poetry forms a parallel with the article about the "en space" which we read a week or two ago. Both find refuge in the negative space. What other forms of media focus around the lack of content as opposed to its presence?

3. One of my coaches for a team I played for in high school told me that "Pittsburgh has a great 'zine scene'". At the time, I thought that was a silly phrase, ignorant to the difference between zines and magazines. However, it is cool to me that, since zines are local, zines are probably more prevalent in some areas than others. Which cities have the best "zine scenes" in the world? Which have the worst?
