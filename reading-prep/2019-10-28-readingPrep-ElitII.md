# Reading Prep: E-lit II

## Questions or Observations

1. Agrippa reminds me of two other artist's books that we've seen in class: the one on the matches and Boundless, the one we saw in the archives. Each of these artist's books plays with the idea that destruction of the book is necessary to read the text contained in the books. Why is this ephemeral nature such an appealing concept to the creators or artist's books?
2. I struggle with the boundaries of e-literature put into Flores's description of the generations of e-literature. At what point does a Snapchat become "e-literature"? Similarly, at what point does a meme become "e-literature"? I don't think I would consider either of those a book at face value.
3. Lazy cat, a YouTube video cited by Flores, is also tough to consider as literature. It has information to be conveyed, but it is a humorous YouTube video. Is a standup comedy special on Netflix a book? I find myself struggling more this week with the boundaries of what is a book. There feels like there needs to be more of a line here.
