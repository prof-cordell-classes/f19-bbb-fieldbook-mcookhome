# Reading Prep: Print I

#### Matthew Cook

## Questions or Observations

1. Gutenberg took inspiration from presses in in wineries to develop his printing press. What inspirations from other disciplines affected the way we consume text today?
2. Considering negative space is something we don't do often, but it is ubiquitous in day-to-day life. How do we see negative space in other forms of art?
3. I truly enjoyed seeing them recreate Gutenberg's original press in the video. When they finally printed it, I finally grasped how much time it took to create each single page, let alone each book. Creation of texts has become much faster in this day and age: how might we see that speed increase in the future?
