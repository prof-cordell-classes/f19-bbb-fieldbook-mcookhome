# Reading Prep: Book Alterities

#### Matthew Cook

## Questions or Observations

1. One of the most important takeaways I've come to this class for is the relation between the book and technology. For that reason, Mod's *The 'Future Book' is Here But It's Not What We Expected* has easily placed itself atop my list of favorite readings from this class thus far. When I think of modern books, my mind immediately rushes to Kindles and other e-readers. However, reading about the private email list via subscription made me realize how ubiquitous and private email is. Is email the decentralized communication medium of our lifetime? What parallels does email have with the US postal system, especially in terms of distributing what we consider to be books?
2. Altered books bring to mind erasure poetry, which we discussed earlier in the course. Both take books as they are and physically change them to make them artistic. It intrigues me as to how they decide which books are "alter-able". Obviously, they opt to not choose religious texts, and from there they choose by monetary value. Is that a fair way to choose which books are candidates for alteration? If not, what makes a book viable to be altered?
3. On another ethical note, the bacterium that is being injected with this xenotext is planned to out-survive humanity. What are the ethical implications of altering an organism's genes for art and entertainment?
