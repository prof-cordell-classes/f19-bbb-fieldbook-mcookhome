# Reading Prep: What is a Book? (Second Half of *The Book*)

#### Matthew Cook

## Questions or Observations

1. On pages 156-157, we learn how authors have used *augmented reality* (AR) to, for lack of a better word, augment books. How do we expect the emergence of the more immersive *virtual reality* (VR) to affect the consumption of books?
2. Are codices without words (muted books, according to Borsuk) truly books if they aren't vessels of information? Arguably, different messages can be taken from any book, but can a book with no concrete words truly be considered a book in any way other than form?
3. The codex has now seen prolific usage for half a millennium, while scrolls and papyrus have exited the mainstream. Do we expect for the codex to ever se complete deprecation?
