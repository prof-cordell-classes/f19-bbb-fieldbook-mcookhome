# Reading Prep: E-lit I

#### Matthew Cook

## Questions or Observations

1. One of the most interesting points that the first article made about modern e-readers was that they spend a lot of time attempting to emulate the feel of a physical codex. Why do e-readers feel the need to do that? Are there ways that e-readers can foster an environment that feels more natural to read in than a codex without expending lots of effort to emulate it? In what time frame do we expect to see such an e-reader?
2. How does sequence affect the way we read? Some crazy works of art present things out of order in a twist on the norm to make the reader reason about which things come when in temporal space. Vonnegut and Tarantino have made works using this gimmick. To what extent do we take order and sequence for granted in the linear media we consume? How do we realize when it is being twisted by the artist? Does it affect our understanding of the piece?
3. The football piece draws an interesting parallel to the short story about how different species read which we read in the first week. The way the story rendered itself between YouTube videos and calendar pages took different shapes on my computer and phone, and seemed somewhat like an *artists book* of the Internet (especially like the JJ Abrams one with commentary in the margins). How do e-lit artists have to consider the differences in rendering on different devices for their visual works? How do they deal with the problems? Do they hire engineers?
