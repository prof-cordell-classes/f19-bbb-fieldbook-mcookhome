# Reading Prep: Paper Circuits

#### Matthew Cook

## Questions or Observations

1. Holl-Jensen's *The Hollow* is similar to *Boundless* in its concealing of content. It continues to infuriate me. Why do authors love to restrict their content in such a way?
2. The interactive copy of Kubla Khan, however, is awesome. To complete a circuit with your fingers that triggers an audio track is genius and must be a surreal experience. I would love to interact with this book.
3. One point that was made in the readings is that 3d printing will become commonplace in future times, somewhat like a refrigerator has now become expected. We take so many technologies for granted; what other's do I need to be more conscious of and grateful for? For me, I definitely didn't realize that the book, and more specifically, the codex, are technologies I've taken for granted my whole life before taking this course.
