# BONUS Reflective: Dragon Prayer Book Event

## Putting the "code" in "codex"

During my lunch break last Thursday, I descended to the archives to attend the event arranged by our archivists called "Read the Dragon". While I engorged myself with veggie pizza, I was astounded to analyze the book Larissa and I had handled in our class's visit to the archives. We noticed how illegible it was, and I ignorantly attributed that quality to it not being English. However, at this event, the first challenge was to match images of *single* letters in the book to letters written in a much more recognizable typeface. Honestly, I couldn't even get all of these correct, which was a bad sign for the rest of the event. The miniscule "c" looked so much like an "r", as its lower curve extension was almost nonexistent. Since "r" wasn't even an option, I guessed blindly that it may be "s", and was stunned when it was revealed to be "c".

The second part of the event that fascinated me was the presence of all of the abbreviations. Every once in a while, the writer of the Dragon Prayer Book would seemingly haphazardly throw a small mark over certain parts of words, which we were told indicated an omission of letters. Not just one letter, letter***s***! The author expected the reader to be able to fill in the blanks. 

> Ah it starts with 'p' and 'e', they'll be able to figure it out it means peace, right

And when I said they do this "every once in a while", I meant they do it at least once per sentence (in my limited experience). It made decoding the sample text *very* hard, and I understand now why they've only been able to decode a small fraction of the book. As for the reasoning behind this ubiquity of abbreviation, I assume that it is an effect of the cost of paper which we discussed in class. Since it was made out of animal skin, it must've been crucial to get as many words down in as little space as possible.

The most infuriating example of this abbreviation will be my final topic of discussion here. In the final challenge, there is a letterform that looks, to me, exactly like a lowercase "m". However, once I realized there was an abbreviation mark above it, I knew I was in for a twisted surprise. The "m" was actually supposed to represent a "c", "i", "r", "c", and the left vertical part of a "u". What I originally saw as a single "m" became *four and a half* letters. In the course of decoding this single contiguous shape of ink, my respect for the tenacity of the "translators" increased tenfold. For this reason, I say that the Dragon Prayer Book puts the "code" in "codex".
