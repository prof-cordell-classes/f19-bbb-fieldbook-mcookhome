# Reading Prep: 3D Printing

## Questions or Observations

1. It is insane to me how little I've thought of how toys teach us things. The Lego anecdote made me think of how all the toys my parents wanted me to play with probably were intended to teach me something. Legos and K'nex were used to teach me engineering basics, books were encouraged to teach me reading comprehension, and playing with marbles helped me understand counting and how they moved. What other toys were intended to teach us things as children?
2. Regarding the Lincoln life mask, does the existence of mass amounts of copies of a book increase or decrease its significance as a text? As a book?
3. The snapshots at the end of the material for this week are helpful in my progressing in the book project. I may consider the thermal-printed poems distributed via Twitter to be a book, but I don't think a hacked video game console would be.
