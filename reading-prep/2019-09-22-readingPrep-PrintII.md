# Reading Prep: Print II

#### Matthew Cook

## Questions or Observations

1. First, using the type this past week made it much easier to understand some of the *Thinking with Type*'s content, especially on page 92. The concepts of metal slugs physically taking up space on to make blank space on the page as well as "leading" between lines made much more sense in regards to the California Job Cases we saw in class.
2. My favorite part of the readings this week was a simple image in the book, without relation to the print. It was a callback to the first couple of weeks in the course in a picture of a manuscript. On the page of this manuscript, the scribe had committed an error and drew a monk climbing up the side of the page to "replace" a piece of faulty text with the correct text conveniently located at the bottom of the page. Having not read too many manuscripts, I was not familiar with this clever practice and quite enjoyed it.
3. The font which I chose is called *Digestive*, which is a font designed by Studio Triple which takes inspirations from seaweed, organs, and pasta. One interesting tidbit of information from the bio of the font is that the maker was playing a lot of a video game called "Binding of Isaac" while making the font, and said that the font was influenced by elements of the video game. I appreciate that the font has an advertised student discount, and I was surprised to realize that the font was still a "Work in Progress", currently on version 0.9.
